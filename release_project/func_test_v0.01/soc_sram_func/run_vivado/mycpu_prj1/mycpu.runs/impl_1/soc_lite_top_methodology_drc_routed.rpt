2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT cpu/ex/mdu/cpun_1_2824_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT cpu/ex/mdu/n_0_3440_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#3 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT cpu/ex/mdu/outPC[31]_i_10 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#1 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at cpu/ex/mdu/p_1_out of size 16x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#2 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at cpu/ex/mdu/p_1_out__0 of size 16x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#3 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at cpu/ex/mdu/p_1_out__1 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#4 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at cpu/ex/mdu/p_1_out__2 of size 18x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cpu/id/id2/ExcCode_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cpu/id/id2/ExcCode_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cpu/id/id2/ExcCode_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cpu/id/id2/ExcCode_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name clk -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports clk] (Source: C:/Users/Microapple/Desktop/release_project/func_test_v0.01/soc_sram_func/run_vivado/soc_lite.xdc (Line: 5))
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: c:/Users/Microapple/Desktop/release_project/func_test_v0.01/soc_sram_func/rtl/xilinx_ip/clk_pll/clk_pll.xdc (Line: 56))
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name clk -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports clk] (Source: C:/Users/Microapple/Desktop/release_project/func_test_v0.01/soc_sram_func/run_vivado/soc_lite.xdc (Line: 5))
